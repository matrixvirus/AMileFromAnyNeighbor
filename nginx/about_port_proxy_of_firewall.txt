    about the problem of when nginx is on a inside net,listen on 80,
    and the firewall on the gateway map the port 8080 of pub ip to
    80 on the nginx server,

    but when open the site from outsite,using pubip:8080,
    when you click some link,the url will becomes to pubip:80.

    the solution to this is,add
        port_in_redirect off;
    to the server block in nginx.conf.
