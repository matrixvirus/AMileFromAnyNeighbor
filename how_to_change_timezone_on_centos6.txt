1
    At the dir /usr/share/zoneinfo,there are many countries,and many cities
    under each country.

    If you current timezone is Asia/Shanghai,then if you run
    $ file /etc/localtime
    you will see it is a symbolink to /usr/share/zoneinfo/Asia/Shanghai.

    To change the timezone,
    remove the current /etc/localtime
    $ rm /etc/localtime

    Create a new /etc/localtime links to another zoneinfo file,for exaple,
    New York,
    $ ln -s /usr/share/zoneinfo/America/New_York /etc/localtime

    See whether the timezone has been changed:
    $ date +%Z
