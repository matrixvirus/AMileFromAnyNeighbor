today,i changed my ss server port to 8088,i can fan again,i tried in
windows,then immediately tried in linux,using sslocal command,but failed,
i tried in windows again,failed.
i changed my ss server port to 8089,i can fan in windows again,and in my
iphone,with the help of a vpn app,with my own ss server. and after
one hour until now,i can fan,i have not tried in linux,i guess that i will
only be blocked when i use sslocal in linux.

but as soon as i wrote the above words,i cant fan in windows.

my Tencent cloud host,in HongKong,cant ping,
i changed an ip.when i was changing,there was a notification in the 
page,you have only one chance to change IP,
after I had changed the IP,i continued to use my shadowsocks for two
days,but today,i found i cant connect to the shadownsocks port 
of my Tencent cloud host,but i can ping it.
