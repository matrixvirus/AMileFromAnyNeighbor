my Tencent cloud host,in HongKong,cant ping,
i changed an ip.when i was changing,there was a notification in the 
page,you have only one chance to change IP,
after I had changed the IP,i continued to use my shadowsocks for two
days,but today,i found i cant connect to the shadownsocks port 
of my Tencent cloud host,but i can ping it.
