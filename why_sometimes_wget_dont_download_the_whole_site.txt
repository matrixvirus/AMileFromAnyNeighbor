    why sometimes wget dont download the whole site.

    because wget will obey the robots.txt on the site,which tells wget what 
    files should not be downloaded,
    so if you use:
    $ wget --mirror http://www.abc.com
    it will not work,

    you could add '-e robots=off',
    $ wget --mirror -e robots=off http://www.abc.com
