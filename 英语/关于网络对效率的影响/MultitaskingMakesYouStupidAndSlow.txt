Multasking Makes You Stupid And Slow
Recommands a long and interesting article over at The Atlantic in which Walter
Kim talks about the scientific results that support his claims and his own
experience with multitasking: that it destroys our ability to focus.
multitasking messes with the brain in several ways. At the most basic level,
the mental balancing acts that it requires - the constant switching and
pivoting - energize the regions of the brain that specialize in visual
processing and physical coordination and simultaneously appear to shortchange
some of the higher areas related to memory and learning. We concentrate on the
act of concentration at the expense of whatever it is that we're supposed to
be concentrating on. studies find that multitasking boosts the level of
stress-related hormones such as cortisol and adrenaline and wears down our

systems through biochemical friction, prematurely aging us. In the short term,
the confusion, fatigue, and chaos merely hamper our ability to focus and
analyze, but in the long term, they may cause it to atrophy.
