How to green light NFS
This document is typed by myself based on a turorial on web, no guaranty
for correct.
Step 1 : Configure NFS Ports
The NFS service uses the RPC Bind service to advertise the protocals/ports
it's using. To make our iptables configure nice and clean, we will statically
configure these ports rather than leave it up to the RPC God to decide.
Edit the NFS port definitions file
    vim /etc/sysconfig/nfs
Uncomment the following lines and save the file
    LOCKD_TCPPORT = 32803
    LOCKD_UDPPORT = 32769
    MOUNTD_PORT = 892
Restart the NFS and RPC Bind services
    /etc/init.d/rpcbind restart
    /etc/init.d/nfs restart
Step 2 : Configure iptables
    iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -p tcp -m multiport --dport \
        111,892,2049,32803 -j ACCEPT
    iptables -I INPUT -m state --state NEW -p udp -m multiport --dport \
        111,892,2049,32803 -j ACCEPT
Note, the port numbers after --dport have no space
